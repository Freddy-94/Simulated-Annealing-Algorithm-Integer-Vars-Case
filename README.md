# Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm-Integer-Vars-Case (Quadratic assignment problem)

This repository will contain an implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm, for an integer variables case.
Our program adjust the simulated annealing algorithm presented here: https://github.com/Freddy-94/Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm-Real-Vars-Case to the case where we consider a cost function of Integer variables, and provide approximate solutions for the quadratic assignment problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_assignment_problem) for problems of size: 9!, 12!, 15!, and 30!
